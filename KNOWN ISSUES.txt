KNOWN ISSUES:

* get() and getElement() dont seem to be returning values. With certain debugging steps, it appears the hashtable cant find the key specified even if its in the table.

* Resizing can cause data corruption. My testing has confirmed the last two lines in the Hashtable appear to be corrupted.
